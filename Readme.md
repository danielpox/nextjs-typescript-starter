# nextjs-typescript-starter

This is a very basic starter package for React applications/sites using Next.js, TypeScript and `styled-components`.

There is also a `demo/markdown-ssr` branch showcasing how to use the starter and how the SSR works by utilizing the `getInitialProps()` lifecycle method provided by Next.js.

## Install

Run `yarn` or `yarn install` to install the package dependencies.

## Usage

Run `yarn dev` to start a Hot Module Reloading development server provided by Next.js.

## Roadmap

The plan is to create a simplistic starter package to kickstart a development environment using these core technologies:
- React (Framework)
- Next.js (Server Side Rendering)
- TypeScript (Typings)
- Styled Components (CSS-in-JS)

It is thought to provide some of the fundamental boilerplate and packages needed to get a project started using these technologies.

Later on a CLI might be created to bootstrap the process with optional addons like Storybook.js, testing and so forth.
